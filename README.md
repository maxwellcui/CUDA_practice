## Introduction
This repository collects my personal codes of CUDA C/C++ practice. While I have the feeling that GPU could be a strong tool
in experimental HEP, I don't have a clear idea on how to use it yet. Neverthelss, I just want to start learning it. Who knows
if one day I can use them in my research.

## Device
The GPU I am using is `Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti`. More info can be found in [(•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-750-ti). You can also get one from Amazon by paying about $120 [ヽ(･ω･｡)ﾉ]( https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=gtx+750+ti).

真正的目的是学会如何100%利用战术核显卡来突破次元壁（误）(　´_ゝ｀)**
